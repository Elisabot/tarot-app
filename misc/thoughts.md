so, what would it look like if we itereated though generating cards? would that give us anything that calling a giant json obj?

on one hand we need cards 1-15 for the minor arcana

on the other we need specific attributes like the imagery on the card and specific title, so what would we be generating? The number. Okay, so we could do that if we want to, but it's also the identifier so maybe we should just log it in the data object.
